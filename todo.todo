- GUI Elements:
	- S
	- Buttons
	- Lists
	- Bigger text fields

- Other stuff:
	- UTF8 sucks, fix the text inputs randomly crashing
	- Ensure if a window is minimized then all the correct events get vwalled
	- Know what to do with the Skin (currently using one global variable gui.Skin, probably not good)
	- Make positioning elements not a pain
	-> Layout system I guess
